    "- There doesn't seem to be a difference between students that find a dev job or not based on the quantity of hours invested in coding.\n",
    "  - Adding only two buckets (more than 10 hours and less than 10 hours) we noticed that students that dedicated more than 10 hours coding are more likely to get a dev job.\n",
    "- Students that fall on the middle on search job hours and coding hours (10 to 20) tend to get jobs earlier.\n",
    "  - There might be other factors as students that find a job later also are mostly within those 10 to 20 hour buckets.\n",
    "- Most students said the bootcamp did help them, so it might not be too relevant for EDA\n"
